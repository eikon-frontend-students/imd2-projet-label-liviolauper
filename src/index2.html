        <h1>Muddy Monk</h1>
        <p class="description">Swiss musician at the crossroads of electronic pop, hazy R&B, and melancholic romanticism, Muddy Monk released Ultra Dramatic Kid (2022) via Half Awake. His cinematic universe, somewhere between introspection and synthetic sensuality, fits perfectly with the label's ethos: artists capable of blending pure emotion with high-quality sound. Half Awake offers him a flexible framework, where aesthetic coherence takes precedence over trends.</p>
